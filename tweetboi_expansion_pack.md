### TWEETBOI EXPANSION PACK

After playing as the tweetboi for a short while a mysterious message is delivered on screen to type into the computer. Once typed, a hidden door opens in the wall. If tweetboi steps through he finds himself in a top secret lab that has apparently been performing research on people like tweetboi, clones. They are all living lives in their "rooms" not knowing about the outside. The lab is void of living people and things have apparently gone horribly wrong. Slaughtered lab assistants become more common as the tweetboi investigates further. 

Strange threats roam the corridors and very sneakily try to kill the tweetboi. He explores a metroidvania like maze of labs and offices, slowly climbing higher and higher, uncovering the mysterious events that have unfolded. Each area has its own monster that stalks the corridor and guard whatever knowledge can bring the tweetboi further.

If the tweetboi dies, he can send the code to another tweetboi clone that hasn't been released yet. They all have a number that can be seen outside their "rooms" when they leave. How this mechanic will work will be tricky, but totally worth it.
